Javascript and Programming basics

Parts of an app:
there are three parts of an application
Front End: what the user sees ie Beauty
Back End: Moving parts of the code ie Braun
Database: Where the data is stored

It is good practice to have
back end , front end and databases seperate
and then added to a bigger overarching program
as modules.


Javascript Variables and Data Types

Javascript is a programming language used with 
other modules and considered
the brains of the front end in an application

A variable is a declaration / data that we want to
utilize later, syntax may vary per language
SYNTAX
var variablename value

CamelCasing
camel casing is common notation for naming
variables looks like myName

to declare a string in JS
use ' ' or " " depending on data stored

Boolean is true or false
define a boolean with 

SYNTAX 
var variablename true/false

Integers are numbers

to print to the console use
console.log(variable)

Computers read code from left 
to right, top to bottom

Languages do not add a space between two strings
so make your own " " variable in the
console.log() statement

the , operator seperates and logs to the console
without them combining into one variable

the + operator adds two variables together



Arrays:
Collection of data, it can have any primitive 
datatypes (strings, ints, bools, floats , chars)
Index
index starts at [0] and then goes up
example of array
["Kyle",4,"Zach", 6]

to call a certain position in an array you use
console.log(array[position])

.length can be used on strings and arrays to figure out how "long"
an array or string is

.push(variable) will add a variable to the "end" of an array
.pop will remove the data stored in the last array position.
